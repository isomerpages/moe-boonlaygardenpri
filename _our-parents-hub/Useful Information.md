<h3>General Office Operating Hours</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The schoolâ€™s General Office will be open from 7am to 5pm, Mondays to Fridays
(excluding public holidays).</p>

<h3>Visit to the School</h3>

Security Guard Post before entering the school premises. Visitors are allowed
access to the Bookshop and General Office only. If you require access to
any other part of the school premises, please proceed to the General Office

<p>To inculcate a sense of personal responsibility and self-management skills
in our students, the school will not accept any items from parents or guardians,
except medications that the students have forgotten to bring.</p>

staff use. For the security and safety of all students, no vehicles will
be allowed to enter the school premises during school hours except for
official business.</p>
