# BLGPS COMMUNITY ART PROJECTS OVER THE YEARS
**Building Communities through Art ― BLGPS Community Art Projects**

As part of our ongoing efforts to bring art to the community and develop our students as active contributors, the school provides students with opportunities to share their art talents with others, as well as showcase their artworks at external platforms.

These community engagement art projects enable our students to apply their art learning in authentic contexts, while learning life lessons about values such as empathy, respect, teamwork, and leadership. This is also in line with the school’s goal to maximise the potential of every child through the provision of a holistic education centred on values and character development. 

1.	BLGPS Art Exhibition 2018

In conjunction with the National Day celebrations, the school organised its first external art showcase at Jurong West Public Library, from 18 August to 9 September 2018. The exhibition shares our students’ passion for the arts, as well as celebrates their artistic talents. Themed “Our Neighbourhood”, the exhibition featured P1 – P6 artworks that depicted the people and places of the school’s neighbourhood.

2.	Collaborative Art-Making Activity with Boon Lay Residents

On 19 May 2018, our Art Club students facilitated a collaborative art-making activity for about 50 Boon Lay residents. Held at BLGPS, the activity provided an opportunity for bonding between Boon Lay residents and students of BLGPS; it also contributed to building a culture of community art-making and arts appreciation in our neighbourhood. The collaborative artworks were displayed at the BLGPS Art Exhibition 2018.

3.	Boon Lay CC PassionArts “Animal Plank Art” Project

Art Club students decorated wooden planks of different animal shapes, e.g. the Lion which symbolises ‘Loving Singapore’ and the Otter Family signifying ‘Family Pursing Arts Together’. These colourful plank art were exhibited at various parts of the Boon Lay neighbourhood, as part of the PassionArts Festival 2018.

Our students also facilitated art activities at the SYF Art Labs, held at Bukit Panjang Plaza on 30 June 2018. They led participants to explore different materials, tools and processes to create textures and transform papers into interesting art forms.
