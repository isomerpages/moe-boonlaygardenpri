‘A Tie That Binds’, the grand finale to Boon Lay Garden’s 40th anniversary celebration, was successfully presented on 22nd September 2017 at Republic Polytechnic. After months of hard work and perseverance, performers put up a spectacular and grandiose performance for the audience. 

Before the actual day, performers and stage crew were involved in two days of intensive rehearsals where they had a chance to experience behind-the-scenes of a musical production.   Despite the long training hours, feelings of joy and excitement were evident on their faces. Pupils and teachers bore the fruit of their labour as they received abundance of commendation from parents and other members of the audience at the end of the show.

Apart from the musical, the audience were also presented with an exhibition showcasing artworks and merchandises made by several groups, such as Sponsor-A-Dream. It was definitely a day to remember in years to come. Well done to all BLGians!
