# 40TH ANNIVERSARY HOMECOMING DINNER
We celebrated our inaugural 40th Anniversary Home-coming Dinner â€“ Blossom @ the Garden on 30 June 2017.  Our Guest of Honour was Mr Patrick Tay, BBM, Advisor to Boon Lay Grassroots Organisations, MP for West Coast GRC (Boon Lay).  There were more than 300 former students, staff and school leaders who attended the event.  It was indeed an event filled with many memories, laughter and reconnecting with former students and staff.
