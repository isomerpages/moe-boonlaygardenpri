# BLGPS ART EXHIBITION AT JURONG WEST PUBLIC LIBRARY
To celebrate Singapore’s 53rd year of independence, Boon Lay Garden Primary School proudly presents our first external art exhibition. Entitled “Our Neighbourhood through the Eyes of Our Children”, the exhibition showcases artworks that depict the people and places of the school’s neighbourhood. It also features the collaborative artworks created by Boon Lay residents and our Art Club students. This exhibition shares our students’ passion for art, as well as celebrates their artistic talents. It is also an opportunity for the school to bring art to our community, thereby contribute to creating a vibrant arts scene in our neighbourhood.  We welcome all parents and students to visit the exhibition.
