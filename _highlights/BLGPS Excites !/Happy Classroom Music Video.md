# HAPPY CLASSROOM MUSIC VIDEO

The ‘Happy Classroom Music Video’ is a ‘Values in Action (VIA)’ project that leverages on the strengths and talents of our teachers and students. In this production, students who had a flair for song-writing, dance and music were identified to make invaluable contributions, while the teachers composed the music and choreographed our very own signature dance moves. Through this music video, the school aims to inculcate a greater sense of ownership among our students in keeping personal and common spaces clean, helping them to cultivate good habits, thus developing them to become socially responsible individuals who contribute meaningfully to the community.
