# TOTAL DEFENCE DAY
BLGPS commemorated Total Defence Day this year, with the theme being "Together We Keep Singapore Strong". The focus for this year is on the different ways we can display the spirit of Total Defence in our daily lives. This year also marks the 50th year of National Service.    

During the week, pre-assembly talks were conducted to allow students to know more about the 5 pillars of Total Defence as well as how each pillar contributes to the growth of Singapore. As part of the commemoration, there were also quizzes and a drawing competition which took place during recess for students to take part. It was an interesting and fruitful day for the students.
