**BLGPS Selected to Showcase Technology in Education 2018**

Think the classroom in BLGPS is a boring place? Think again! Take a peek into the 21st century classroom in BLGPS!

Active Learning with technology makes learning in EL classrooms REAL - Reflective, Engaging, Active and Lively. Using the Singapore Learning Space (SLS), students engage in thinking through discussion, negotiation and meaning making to refine their understanding of concepts. 

"But how does technology enhance the interactions in the classroom?" you ask. The use of technology allows for peer feedback and the consolidation of student responses in real time. This enables students to learn actively in a collaborative setting, building on each other's ideas to co-construct meaning thereby allowing rich discussions to take place in the classroom. Watch the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fX1A35FNIuQ) to see how we prepare our students to be future ready with strong fundamentals!
