# INTERGENERATIONAL LEARNING PROGRAMME (ILP)

![](/images/ILP%20PICTURES.jpg)

Initiated by Council for Third Age (C3A), the ILP is organised by Family Central to promote lifelong learning and to forge intergenerational bonding between the youths and the seniors. Boon Lay Garden Primary school is honoured to be given the opportunity to facilitate an art-making activity session with the seniors from all over Singapore.

On 24 May 2019, our Art Club students facilitated a collaborative art-making activity for about 25 seniors. The activity aims to provide an opportunity for bonding between the seniors and students of BLGPS. The students enthusiastically shared their learning with the residents and offer them lots of useful advice and practical tips. They are wonderful art ambassadors of BLGPS and have done the school proud!
