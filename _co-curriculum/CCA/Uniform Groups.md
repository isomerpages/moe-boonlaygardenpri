# Uniform Groups
**Red Cross**
![](/images/stjohn.jpg)
Red Cross aims to grow our students into compassionate and helpful individuals through acquiring basic First Aid knowledge and skills. Our programme includes First Aid and rescue, community service, homecraft and many fun-filled activities such as community singing, games and dances. We also organise combined activities with other Uniformed Groups and Cadet-Link events with our secondary schools partners.
