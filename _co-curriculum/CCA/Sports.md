Track & Field is not just about sprinting, long distance running or throwing. It is a holistic approach where one needs to focus, plan, execute, ponder and reflect. BLGPS Track & Field serves to give our students the chance to stretch their limits not just physically but mentally as well. Working as a team will enable them to be exposed to diversity amongst their peers and give them the opportunity to work towards achieving their goals.
