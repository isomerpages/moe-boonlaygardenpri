Track & Field is not just about sprinting, long distance running or throwing. It is a holistic approach where one needs to focus, plan, execute, ponder and reflect. BLGPS Track & Field serves to give our students the chance to stretch their limits not just physically but mentally as well. Working as a team will enable them to be exposed to diversity amongst their peers and give them the opportunity to work towards achieving their goals.

## Floorball

Floorball is a relatively new sport that has been making waves in the local sports scene. The sport has seen great development ever since it was introduced to Singapore and it has steadily gained popularity among the students in schools.
The fast-paced indoor sport that blends elements of ice hockey with other team sports, such as football and basketball, is good for heart health as the sport is a high intensity physical activity. The sport also helps to build muscles, endurance and stamina. Players develop explosive power, cardiovascular and muscular endurance, as well as improve their agility, as the game requires them to change direction quickly.
Although being a relatively new CCA, the students has exceeded the expectation of the teachers by reaching the 2nd round of the Junior and Senior Floorball Championship for the past 2 years in a row.
