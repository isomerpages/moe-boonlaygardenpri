Chinese Dance aims to provide students with the opportunity to learn and appreciate Chinese Dance. Students are trained in basic Chinese Dance moves through stretching and developmental exercises. They participate in Chinese Dance performances in school events, external performances in the community and the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF). In addition to learning the dance, students also go for Chinese Dance performances by other schools and organizations as a form of exposure.

Malay Dance is opened to all students who have the talent and interest in dancing.  Students will be taught basic dance skills so that they can enjoy the dance as a recreation and also to prepare them for dance performances. Students will be trained by an experienced dance instructor who has led the team in performing on several occasions, in and outside school. Identified students get to take part in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) too. We hope our students will master the dance moves, learn to work together in a team and enjoy themselves during the dance practice sessions.
