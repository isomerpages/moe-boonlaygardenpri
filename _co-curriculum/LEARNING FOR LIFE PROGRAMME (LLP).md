**PROGRAMMES (FOR ALL PUPILS)**

**Earth Hour**
![](/images/Earth%20Hour.png)
Earth Hour was first started in 2007 to raise global awareness on energy conservation and climate change. Through energy conservation, we can reduce carbon emission and thus reduces the impact of global warming such as strange weather phenomenon, raising temperature and melting of sea ice. BLGPS played our part in the Earth hour campaign by switching off the fans in our school compound for an hour on 24 March 2016 from 7.30am to 8.30am. On top of that, an assembly talk on global warming and deforestation was conducted to raise awareness about the urgent need to conserve the environment. At the end of the assembly talk, we also got everyone to stand up and do a tree pose balance in support of WWF in breaking a world record of forming the world's largest tree pose balance! 

**AUTHOR TALK ON GLOBAL WARMING WITH OTTO FONG**<br>
Our pupils were meaningfully engaged in the sharing on global warming by Otto Fong. Through the sharing session, Mr Fong shared with the pupils how pollution and climate change may eventually lead to mass extinction of species; and how we can do our part in stopping global warming. 

**INTERCLASS RECYCLING COMPETITION**

As part of the BLGPS Green Week, an interclass recycling competition was organised. Responses from our pupils were overwhelming and we collected a whopping total of 820kg of newspaper and 40kg of fabrics! We would like to thank all pupils, staff and parents for their warm support! The proceeds from the sale of the recyclables were donated to WWF in support of the wildlife conservation.  

**COMMUNITY OUTREACH PROGRAMME @ BOON LAY SHOPPING CENTRE**

In line with our commitment to expand our collaboration with external agencies and communities, the Science and CCE departments are pleased to collaborate with Boon Lay Merchants Association for our pupils to conduct a community outreach programme at Boon Lay Shopping Centre in Term 2 Week 6. We were honoured to be able to share with the residents the environmental conservation programmes that we have been conducting in school; ways to reduce waste as well as exhibition cum hands on session on crafts that can be made using recycled materials! Our pupils had a wonderful time mingling with our fellow residents!

The school is once again pleased to collaborate with Boon Lay Residents Committee to conduct a community outreach programme at Blk 185 Boon Lay Estate Community Garden on 4 May 2016. Our pupils had a meaningful and engaging time sharing with the residents on steps to prevent mosquito breeding and we also engaged our residents in the DIY terrarium making! On top of that, our pupils also get to learnt more about gardening from the resident volunteers and we were thrilled to have our Member of Parliament, Mr Patrick Tay to join us in the event!  

**BLGPS GREEN WEEK**

The annual BLGPS Green Week was conducted in Term 2 Week 5 to raise pupils’ awareness of 4Rs through fun and engaging activities. Throughout the week, pupils were engaged in activities such as games and crafts booths during the level recesses, pre-assembly talk on 4Rs conducted by their fellow school mates and an assembly talk on water conservation conducted by the Waterways Watch Society Singapore. All materials and resources used for the games and craft booths were made from recyclable materials. The school’s environmental club members and P4 - P6 class environmental ambassadors were deployed to mend the booths during their level recesses. 

**TREE PLANTING DAY**
![](/images/Tree%20Planting.png)
A kedongdong tree was symbolically planted in our school by the P6 graduating cohort on 20th May 2016 as part of Green Wave 2016. We see the need for us to take a keen interest in environmental protection and implement this ideal in action by planting a young tree annually and taking care of the existing ones. We have specifically chosen the Kedongdong tree as the fruits are commonly used as a food source in South East Asia. 

**PROGRAMMES (FOR ACE CLUB MEMBERS AND CLASS ENVIRONMENT AMBASSADORS)**

The Panasonic-NEA Environment Champions (Schools) Industry Module [ECIM] is a platform for students to gain first-hand knowledge of environmental measures adopted by industries, such as energy conservation, resource conservation and pollution control, with coaching from Panasonic staff.  A group of our trained environment champions attended the workshop during the March holidays and they even get to construct their own solar powered lamps! 

**JUNIOR ENVIRONMENT AMBASSADORS**

The JEA Training Camp, which is a part of the Green Schools @ South West 2016 programme, serves as a platform to impart environmental knowledge and skills to train and empower student leaders. A group of P3 – P4 Junior Environment Ambassadors attended the workshop on 14 March 2016. The pupils subsequently did a sharing session with their peers on the environmental knowledge that they learnt during the camp.
