### Our Approach

We provide students with opportunities to develop and practise good health habits and attitudes through a variety of learning experiences. Students learn fundamental movement skills and games skills to develop movement competency through well-designed PE lessons and programmes which incorporate Differentiated Instruction, Active Blended Learning and thinking routines. They then transfer these skills across the PE learning areas namely Athletics, Dance, Games & Sports, Gymnastics, Outdoor Education, Physical Health & Fitness and Swimming.

### Key Programmes

#### SPORTS EDUCATION PROGRAMME (SEP)

The SEP aims to turn sports into a lifelong passion for students by introducing novel and interesting sports and games experiences to them. The school’s SEP features Wushu, iBounce, Bowling, Rollerblading, Archery and Tchoukball. Apart from creating interest and curiosity, it helps to build their fundamental movement skills by developing agility, speed and coordination which are necessary for the development of sports skills.

#### P5 OUTDOOR ADVENTURE LEARNING CAMP

The outdoors was used as a natural classroom, for our P5 students to develop ruggedness, resilience and build strong ties with each other. Students had opportunity to exhibit Habits of Mind and CARES values through meaningful camp activities and challenges such as low elements, nature hike, sheltered teambuilding and sensory navigation.
