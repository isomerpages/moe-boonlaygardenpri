### Our Goals

To foster students’ interest in Mathematics and develop them to be Confident and Eager Problem-Solvers.  
  
The Primary Mathematics Syllabus aims to enable all students to:  

*   acquire mathematical concepts and skills for everyday use and continuous learning in mathematics, 
*   develop thinking, reasoning, communication, application, and metacognitive skills through a mathematical approach to problem-solving and 
*   build confidence and foster interest in mathematics.

### Our Approach

The school is committed to grow our students as problem-solvers by providing opportunities for them to develop their curiosity and interest in Mathematics through games and authentic learning experiences. They are also taught problem solving skills using the STAR approach, adapted from Polya’s problem solving techniques.

### Key Programmes

#### AUTHENTIC LEARNING EXPERIENCES  

Students learn better through exploration and discovery. Through Learning Experiences, students deploy mathematical processes and skills to solve real-world problems. This is key to learning Mathematics for use in everyday life, and makes the learning of Mathematics more meaningful.

#### SELF-DIRECTED BLENDED LEARNING

With technology, students are able to learn mathematical concepts at their own pace independently. Through these lessons, students can deepen their conceptual understanding and teachers are able to assess students’ learning formatively.

#### FUN WITH MATHEMATICS (P3 TO P6)

Each term, activities involving games and puzzles that train students in their problem solving capabilities are infused into the curriculum to actively engage students in their learning. This programme aims to develop students in their critical thinking skills and thinking habits such as ‘Thinking Flexibly’ and ‘Thinking about Thinking’.

#### DIFFERENTIATED SUPPORT FOR EVERY CHILD

1.  EXCELLENCE 2000 MATHEMATICS (E2K MATHEMATICS)  <br>
To further develop the potential of students in Mathematics, selected P4 and P5 students who demonstrate high interest and ability in Mathematics are selected to join in the E2K Mathematics programme. The programme aims to develop students' mathematical reasoning skills and deepens their conceptual understanding through an inquiry approach. Students will have opportunities to work independently or collaborate with their peers and engage in mathematical thinking through resources such as puzzles, games and mathematical explorations specially designed for this programme.

2. MATHEMATICS OLYMPIADS  <br>
To help students who are talented in Mathematics achieve Excellence, the school provides opportunities for these students to attend enrichment classes and participate in selected competitions.  
  
3. LEARNING SUPPORT PROGRAMME (MATHEMATICS)  <br>
The school supports students who require additional help in the learning of mathematics through the Learning Support Programme. These students learn in an environment that is designed to help them bridge their learning gaps.  
  
4. MATHEMATICS REMEDIAL PROGRAMMES  <br>
To provide support for our learners, selected students are invited to join in the remedial programmes. Time and space are provided to help students bridge their learning gaps.
