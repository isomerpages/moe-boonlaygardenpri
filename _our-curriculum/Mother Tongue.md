### Our Goals

To equip students with the necessary communication skills as well as cultural knowledge to enable students to be active learners and proficient users of the respective Mother Tongue Language.

### Our Approach

To enable students to gain cultural knowledge, the programmes are thoughtfully tailored to immerse students deeply in a diverse cultural environment and expose them to different cultural practices. Programmes also allow students to learn through listening of music and arts.

### Key Programmes

**MTL FORTNIGHT**

Students are exposed to a wide range of cultural activities and allow authentic usage of Chinese, Malay and Tamil language through competitions and lessons.
