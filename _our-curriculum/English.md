### Our Goals


To develop in students a love for the English language, and empower them to be Discerning Readers, Empathetic Communicators, and Creative Inquirers.

### Our Approach

In achieving the student outcomes, the school is guided by the STELLAR 2.0 curriculum from MOE, focusing on the progressive attainment of language skills. The school strives to provide students with a holistic language learning experience to ensure that they grow as competent users of the language. The curriculum is structured to maximize opportunities for the development of reading, writing, speaking, and listening skills. As students progress, they engage in activities to strengthen their fundamentals, and prepare them to be language users of the future.

### Key Programmes

**MODIFIED LANGUAGE EXPERIENCE APPROACH (MLEA)**  

Through shared experiences, students learn to express themselves in writing as part of a group. The learning process is enriched through peer sharing of ideas and feedback from the teachers. Students gradually develop the skills and confidence to compose their individual writing.

**SPEECH AND DRAMA**

Through story-telling, students are taught how to express emotions and thoughts using a repertoire of vocabulary, intonation, body language, movement and stance. This helps them to appreciate narrative elements and hones their ability to speak confidently in front of an audience.

**ENGLISH LANGUAGE WEEK**

Students engage in fun activities taking place throughout the week, making learning of language come alive. They discover how reading can broaden their horizon, expanding their knowledge in areas of their own interests.
