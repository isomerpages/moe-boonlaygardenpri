### Our Goals

In order to nurture an inquiring community of learners, the school seeks to:

*   To enthuse and nurture students’ interest in Science
*   To inculcate the spirit of inquiry through providing first-hand learning experience for our students.

The Science Curriculum Framework is derived from the Policy Framework for the Teaching and Learning of Science. It encapsulates the thrust of science education in Singapore to prepare our students to be sufficiently adept as effective citizens, able to function in and contribute to an increasingly technologically-driven world. _(Source: Ministry of Education, Science Syllabus Primary, 2014)_

### Our Approach

Based on our belief that every child can be an inquirer, the school is committed to guiding our students gain Science related knowledge and skills, inculcate positive ethics and attitudes and most importantly, develop a life-long interest in learning Science through standards-based curriculum that includes inquiry based learning through Blended Active Learning B(A)L cycle and quality learning experience (outdoor experiential learning, investigation and experimentation). In line with the school’s 3E approach, students have opportunities to uncover their strength in Science and showcase their talent on internal and external platforms.

### Key Programmes

**LEVEL-BASED LEARNING JOURNEYS**  

Students learn best when they can apply their knowledge to real-world contexts. The learning journeys enable them to see the concepts that they learn in class come to life!  
  
**CLASS BASED HANDS ON EXPERIMENTATION LESSONS**  

Concepts are better learned when the students can see it happening for themselves, rather than reading about it from the textbook. This allows them to become young Scientists, discovering the concepts through experimentation and discovery.

**LEVEL BASED ENRICHMENT** 

To stretch our students’ interest in the subject, each level has specific enrichment programmes catered to suit the curriculum and learning interests of the students. As the students progress to the upper primary, they will also contribute their knowledge and concepts to the school’s environmental education efforts.  

*   P3 (Eco Garden Trail / Every Child a Seed)
*   P4 (Ice Box Challenge)
*   P5 (Hydroponics Workshop)
*   P6 (Community in Nature, NParks / Biodiversity Week)

**DIFFERENTIATED SUPPORT FOR EVERY CHILD**  

1. EXCELLENCE 2000 SCIENCE (E2K SCIENCE) <br>
To further develop the potential of students in Science, selected P4 and P5^ students who demonstrate high interest and ability in Science are selected to join in the E2K Science programme. The programme that was launched in 2022 aims to foster independence and confidence in scientific inquiry; and provides opportunities for students to develop science process skills and 21st century competencies such as resilience and resourcefulness, critical and inventive thinking, and effective communication skills.  
^E2K Science for P5 students will start in 2023  
  
2. P5 ABBOTT YOUNG SCIENTIST <br>
Selected students who are on financial assistance or from disadvantaged background are awarded the Abbott Young Scientist bursary that provides opportunities for students to undergo a customised mentorship programme to work on a project of their choice. The programme is organised by Science Centre Singapore and Abbott Laboratories, supported by the Ministry of Education. This programme is valuable in providing an opportunity for students to develop an interest in science and be exposed to content useful to them in school.  
  
3. P5 DA VINCI NOBEL WINTER WORKSHOP  <br>
Selected students are invited to participate in the Da Vinci Nobel Winter Workshop organised by NUS High School. The workshops aim to imbue in students a sense of wonder and a pioneering spirit, and show how their passion in science can benefit the world and improve the quality of lives around them.  
  
4. SCIENCE REMEDIAL PROGRAMMES  <br>
To provide support for our learners, selected students are invited to join in the remedial programmes. Time and space are provided to help students bridge their learning gaps.
