### Our Goals

Project Work (PW) in BLGPS is an independent subject that is integrated into the formal curriculum. Through PW, students will be able to apply their understanding of knowledge from various subject disciplines and creatively apply it to real life situations.  
  
Aligned with MOE Project Work, PW’s learning outcomes focus on communication, collaboration, knowledge application and independent learning. These skills prepare our students for lifelong learning and future challenges.  
  
In this programme we strive to nurture our students to be:  

1.  Empathetic problem-solvers who are attuned to environmental and community issues; 
2.   Collaborators who will actively play their roles so as to bring about positive changes; and 
3.   Advocators who share their beliefs with their peers and influence change.

### Our Approach

The PW curriculum is anchored by the BLGPS PW Problem-Solving framework which was partially adapted from Design Thinking. The lessons and activities in PW serve to imbue in students a systematic approach towards problem solving. Students go through the EmPower Cycle to deepen their understanding towards the environment and hone various skills while solving problems.

### Key Programmes

In BLGPS, PW revolves around sustainability issues , in line with our school’s LLP in Environment Education to develop our students as eco-stewards of the environment. PW is also a key platform to help our students acquire ICT Baseline Skills, such as touch typing and digital literacy skills such as research skills.
