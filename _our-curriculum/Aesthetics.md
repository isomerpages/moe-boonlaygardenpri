### Our Approach

Our level and school-wide Aesthetics programmes seek to introduce a variety of art and music forms and genres to students progressively, while providing them with opportunities to extend their learning beyond the classroom walls.

### Key Programmes

**ART PROGRAMMES**  

Here in BLGPS, students engage in a range of art inquiry through a variety of art forms and media. These meaningful art-making experiences allow students to explore and experiment with art materials and processes, and create artworks to share their imagination, thoughts and feelings. Students acquire skills to observe, describe and interpret artworks, and learn to appreciate art from different cultures and contexts.  
  
The school programme provides opportunities for students to explore and experiment different art forms. The level-wide programmes include Wax Resist, Cubism, Collage, 3D Artwork, Symbolism, Modular & Wire Sculpture, Optical Art, Modular Font Design, and Watercolour Painting.  
  
**P4 MUSEUM-BASED LEARNING TO NATIONAL GALLERY SINGAPORE**  

Students got a glimpse of life in Singapore in the past, engaged in perspective-taking through role-play and tapped on their imagination as they envisioned how they would be as the characters and visual matter in the artworks. They also marveled at the space and its history of National Gallery to design a version of their own museums back in the school!

**COMMUNITY ART**  

We collaborated with Mind.Art.Experiental Lab (MAELab) to play our part in raising the awareness of mental well-being in our youths. Our students and alumnus expressed themselves creatively using various skillsets and art techniques learned through a mentorship programme with an artist. The collaboration culminated in a public art exhibition ‘Teens and Kins’ that was graced by Dr Janil Puthucheary, Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information and Health.

**MUSIC “LEARN-TO-PLAY” PROGRAMMES**  

For music, students learn to play a range of musical instruments. They are equipped with the musical capacities to express themselves musically and are exposed to an array of music repertoire to expand their musical experiences. 

Similar to the Art development, the school has in place level-wide programmes to develop students’ musical talents across different areas such as Music & Movement, Percussion, Digital Drums, Recorders, Keyboard, Digital Music, Ukulele and Ensemble Playing.
