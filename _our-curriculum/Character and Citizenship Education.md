### Our Goals

Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is integral to the holistic development of our students, leading to positive life outcomes. The school provides an integrated approach to addressing our students’ development of values, character, social-emotional well-being and citizenship dispositions in a coherent and holistic way.

### Our Approach

The CCE curriculum in BLGPS is anchored on MOE’s CCE 2021 Curriculum Frame. The fundamentals of core values, a sense of purpose and social-emotional competencies are taught in the six content areas which includes National Education (NE), Cyber Wellness and Mental Health.

*   The six CCE core values, namely Responsibility, Resilience, Respect, Integrity, Care and Harmony complement our school’s CARES values. To deepen students’ connection and internalisation of these values, values are unpacked on a ternly basis and classes are named after the CCE values. 
		 
*   The focus on mental health and well-being in CCE guides students to be resilient and develops their social-emotional knowledge and skills such as emotional regulation, self-control and positivity. Besides mental health education, the school raises mental health awareness and encourages a caring and supportive environment through two annual events: BLGPS Celebrates Wellness in Term 2 and the commemoration of World Mental Health Day in Term 4.  
    

The school emphasises a holistic approach in teaching CCE, and taps on multiple learning platforms for explicit teaching, reinforcement, and application of learning. These platforms include CCE lessons within the classroom, and learning beyond the classroom through key student development experiences such as: 3E and VANDA, student leadership, Co-curricular Activities (CCA) and Values-in-Action (VIA).  
  
To further strengthen CCE learning across multiple platforms, the school places an importance on building positive teacher-student and peer relationships, and strengthening home-school partnerships.  

### Key Programmes

#### CCE - FORM TEACHER GUIDANCE PERIOD (FTGP) 

In CCE (FTGP) lessons, students learn fundamental social-emotional skills and discuss how they are related to values and citizenship dispositions. A variety of topics is explored, and time is also set aside for learning about personal strengths and interests, commemoration of the four NE days, and class bonding activities.  
  
#### CCE - MOTHER TONGUE LANGUAGE (MTL) 

Cultural stories, songs, proverbs and practices hold a wealth of knowledge for teaching moral values and are rich in examples of how we can live a life of purpose. Through CCE (MTL) lessons, students have additional exposure to their mother tongue languages and gain a deeper understanding of moral values which are closely intertwined with language and culture.  
  
#### CCE - PROGRAMME FOR ACTIVE LEARNING (PAL) 

PAL is offered at the Primary 1 and 2 levels and it focuses on experiential and hands-on learning through the domains of Visual and Performing Arts, Outdoor Education, and Sports and Games. There are great opportunities for students to experiment, explore and interact with their peers, and in doing so, students develop positive dispositions such as being curious about the world, and belief in personal ability to overcome challenges.
