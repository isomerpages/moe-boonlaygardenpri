<h2>Gratitude in Action: Celebrating Our Teachers</h2>

As we continue our #BLGratitude journey, we invite our school family to
nominate deserving teachers for two prestigious national awards.</p>

and belonging. When we recognise our teachers' dedication, we model appreciation
and build a culture of care that benefits everyone.</p>

educators who inspire through innovative teaching, mentorship, and professional
excellence.</p>

<h2>"Hearts and Plates: A Delicious Success for a Good Cause!"</h2>
<p>Our BLGPS staff exemplified the spirit of giving through the 'Hearts &amp;
Plates' Staff Culinary Connection event! Teachers and staff members donned
their chef hats, transforming our canteen into a vibrant marketplace of
culinary delights. Through this innovative fundraiser for the President's
Challenge Heart Train 2025, our school community came together in a meaningful
celebration of food, culture, and compassion.</p>
<p>Beyond the delectable dishes served, this event showcased how educators
can be powerful role models of compassionate contribution. By leveraging
their unique strengths and cultural knowledge, our staff demonstrated that
professional growth and community service can go hand in hand. The event
fostered meaningful peer learning opportunities while strengthening our
One-BLGPS spirit.</p>
