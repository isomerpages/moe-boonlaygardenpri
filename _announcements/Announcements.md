<h4>Ordinary Humans, Extraordinary Humanity!</h4>
<p>3 of our BLGians were recognised at the Silent Heroes Award ceremony organised
by CAS – Civilians Association (Singapore). The aim of the award is to
recognise ordinary, everyday Singaporeans and Permanent Residents for their
extraordinary humanity and compassion towards people, causes, and missions.</p>
<p>The award is open nation-wide and is presented to individuals who are
working silently without recognition or compensation. They are the faceless
champions of our society — ordinary humans who have demonstrated extraordinary
dedication to improving the lives of their fellow human beings.</p>
