The Teachers’ Conference and ExCEL Fest is a celebration of professional learning among Singapore teachers, and it brings local educators together to learn, connect and engage with each other. This year, the theme of TCEF 2023 is ‘Ignite Imagination. Empower Communities. Transform Practice’. It reinforces the education fraternity’s emphasis on lifelong learning and supports educators in: continually deepening beliefs, gaining a better understanding of students, and further strengthening classroom practice to nurture future-ready learners.

Our school is proud to have presented a digital poster at the conference to share our efforts in developing students’ strengths and interests in CCAs using the _3E: Experience, Enrichment and Excellence_ approach. Through the poster, participants learnt about the opportunities for students to discover their strengths and interests at the Experience stage, and how the school develops students’ knowledge and skills through Enrichment and Excellence-stage programmes.
