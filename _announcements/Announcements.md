#### TEACHER'S DAY 2023

We know that you wish to come back to see your former teachers. We also wish that we could have all of you gathered in school like this. 

As our school has been designated as a polling centre for Presidential Election, we are unable to host alumni on 31 August.

Not to worry! You can still leave your special thanks and wishes for your teachers on this MOE page specially created for teachers at [https://thankyoucher.edu.sg](https://thankyoucher.edu.sg)
