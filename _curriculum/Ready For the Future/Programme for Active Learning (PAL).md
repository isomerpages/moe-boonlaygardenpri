# PROGRAMME FOR ACTIVE LEARNING (PAL)

PAL@BLGPS is an initiative introduced at P1 and P2, with the aim to facilitate the holistic development of our students in the moral, physical, aesthetics and emotional domains of learning. Our programme consists of modules of activities in two broad areas - Sports & Games and Outdoor Education, and Performing Arts and Visual Arts.  

During PAL lessons, our P1 and P2 BLGians enjoy learning experiences that are active, hands-on and meaningful. Through these experiences, we hope to develop their soft skills such as the ability to cooperate with others and a belief to accomplish a task or deal with a challenge.  

**PAL@BLGPS : Developing Confidence, Curiosity and Cooperation in our pupils.**
