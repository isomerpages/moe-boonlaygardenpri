**OVERVIEW**<br>
*EVERY CHILD MATTERS*

We believe that every child has their own needs and unique strengths. Each child deserves the opportunity to develop his/her talents to the fullest to be a useful citizen with good character.

**PROGRAMMES**<br>
**CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES**

1. Form-Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) Lessons 
- During FTGP lessons, activities and positive interactions take place between form teacher and his/her students so as to enhance bonding between form teacher and students. In addition, FTGP will also cater for the explicit teaching of social emotional competencies which contributes to positive teacher-student relationships. 

2. CCE Lessons

3. CARES @ BLGPS

1. NE Commemorative Events: 
 - Total Defence Day (TDD) – The school commemorated TDD, focusing on the importance of the five aspects of Total Defence; the Military Defence, Civil Defence, Economic Defence, Social Defence and Psychological Defence. Lessons were also planned for our students to have a deeper understanding on the commemoration of Total Defence Day. 

- International Friendship Day (IFD) - IFD is a day dedicated to the understanding of Singapore's relations with neighbouring countries and beyond. It aims to sensitise our children towards the geo-political realities inherent in Singapore, as well as nurture in our students the spirit of friendship and collaboration among different people. During the day, our students are able to welcome their international peers to the school, understand more of their cultures and forge strong bonds of friendship. 

- Racial Harmony Day (RHD) - Schools commemorate RHD to give our students a platform to reflect on and celebrate Singapore success as a harmonious nation and society built on a rich diversity of cultures and heritages. Students should learn to make friends with people of other races and religions and not make fun of people who are different. 

- National Day - The theme for this year’s National Day Parade (NDP) is “Building our Singapore of Tomorrow". “Building” implies that nation-building is a continuous endeavour and that the journey towards our future can be realised with hard work. “Our Singapore” invokes in Singaporeans a sense of belonging and rootedness to the country and our future. “Tomorrow” is forward looking and connotes the start of the next chapter post SG50. Taken together, the theme is a call to action for Singaporeans to build our future together. 

- NE Show - The National Education (NE) Show has been organised to instil a sense of patriotism in students and to bring across the significance of our National Day. This year, the NDP full dress rehearsal, which will be held at The National Stadium, provides an opportunity for organisers to inculcate NE values in our students.

3. Values-In-Action (VIA)

The school has provided multiple platforms for students’ VIA activities such as Happy Classroom, Use Your Hand Campaign and visits to old folks homes. 
 
4. Social Studies (SS)
