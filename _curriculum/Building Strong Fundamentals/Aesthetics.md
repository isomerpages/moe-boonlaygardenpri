**OVERVIEW**<br>
Every child, an artist. Every child, a musician.

At Boon Lay Garden Primary School, we believe that all children are musical, and every child is an artist. Our student-centred arts programmes aim to:

**Art**
*	Enable every child to be visually literate and to appreciate art.

**Music**
*	Develop awareness and appreciation of music in local and global cultures
*	Develop ability for creative expression and communication through music
*	Provide the basis to develop an informed and life-long involvement in music
