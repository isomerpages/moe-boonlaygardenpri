At BLGPS, we seek to provide 5 experiences for our students. Technological Experience is one of them. The digital Citizenship, skills Acquisition and learning Redefined! (CAR) model guides the school in providing a holistic learning experience for our pupils. Our vision is to equip our students with the necessary skills and values so that they will be life-long learners. 

The word CAR also reminds us that being life-long learners is a life-long journey and we should never stop learning no matter whether we are young or old.


**DIGITAL CITIZENSHIP**<br>
The digital world is very much a part of our lives today. Being connected to a global community also means that our pupils are no longer confined to the school for interaction and learning. Thus, we want our students to be grounded with sound values and ethics so that they are able to live and thrive in the digital world. 

Just like how the steering wheel of a car allows the driver control the car. Similarly, being equipped with digital citizenship values and ethics will ensure our students stay on the right track.

Implementation Strategies:
1.	Whole School Approach to Cyber wellness
2.	Cyber Wellness Ambassador
3.	Media Literacy in Interdisciplinary Project Work (IPW) and Social Studies
4.	Cyber wellness for Staff


**SKILLS ACQUISITION**<br>
In order for students to use technology to enable their learning, they need a basic level of knowledge and skills in various tools. These skills will be necessary when they progress into the working world which is very much driven by technology.

Just like how all cars have its basic structure like wheels and chassis. Similarly, our pupils need to be equipped with a basic set of technological skills to enable them to learn with technology as well as be prepared for the future workforce.

Implementation Strategies:
1.	Baseline ICT Skills Acquisition Curriculum
2.	Integration into Interdisciplinary Project Work (IPW)

**LEARNING REDEFINED!**<br>
The Substitution Augmentation Modification Redefinition (SAMR) model was developed by Dr. Ruben Puentedura. The model offers a method of seeing how technology might impact teaching and learning.  At its highest level of Redefinition, the technology allows for the creation of new tasks, previously inconceivable.

By redefining our students' learning, we grow them into self-directed and collaborative learners. We also equip them with the ability to think and ask questions when in doubt.

Just like the car engine moves the car, redefining our students learning will allow them to learn and achieve greater heights.

Implementation Strategies:
1.	Flipped Learning
2.	Chromebooks for High Progress Learners
3.	LBIS (Jakarta) Collaboration
4.	Singapore – Canada Math Collaboration
