Boon Lay Garden Primary School aims to nurture students who are Future Ready with Strong Fundamentals – each a Thinker, Leader and Contributor imbued in values and equipped with knowledge, skills and 21st century competencies to progress and embrace the future. In the Garden where Diversity Blossoms, we also seeks to maximize the diverse talents and interests of each child through the Hi-5 Experiences – Intellectual, Technological, Arts & Cultural, Lifeskills & Leadership.
