*For the Love of Our Children*

BLGPS Parents Support Group (PSG) plays an important role in promoting and fostering home-school partnership to support the holistic development of BLGians. The committee which was first formed in 1999 also plays a part in establishing and enhancing 2-way communication between school and parents.

This year, the committee has 29 Executive Committee members and 126 active members supporting the school in two main areas: Character Development of Students and as Ambassadors of BLGPS.
