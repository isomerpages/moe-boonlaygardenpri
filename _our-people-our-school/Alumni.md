# ALUMNI
Since the start of Boon Lay Garden Primary School in 1977, the school has seen many of its graduands become successful individuals. We are a school that embraces its vision of ‘A Garden where Diversity Blossoms’. We create opportunities for our students to grow holistically and help them discover their strengths and talents. 

It is timely for the school to strengthen its ties with our alumni after 40 long years of history. We treasure the relationship you had with the school. Therefore, we would like to be the link between you and your former BLGPS schoolmates and teachers and at the same time create opportunities for you to contribute your time and talent to your alma mater.
