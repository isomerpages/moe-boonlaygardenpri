Since 1977, the school has seen many of its graduates become successful individuals. The school continues to be heartened to see that the opportunities presented to BLGians have allowed them to grow holistically and helped them discover their strengths. They have gone on to further develop their strengths in various institutions and industries and let their passions take flight beyond BLGPS.

It is timely for the school to strengthen its ties with our alumni, as we treasure the relationship all BLGians have with the school. The school looks to forge strong links between graduated BLGians and BLGPS, to create opportunities for graduates to contribute their time and strengths to their alma mater. Once a BLGian, always a BLGian.
