### Objectives of PSG

BLGPS Parents Support Group (PSG) plays an important role in promoting and fostering home-school partnership to support the holistic development of BLGians. The PSG also plays an integral part in establishing and enhancing 2-way communication between school and parents.

Guided by the motto ‘For the Love of Our Children’, our PSG parents equip themselves with relevant skills and knowledge during our termly meetings and workshops so that they can continue to be strong partners and ambassadors for the school.

### Partnering the school

Apart from termly meetings and workshops, our PSG parents engage and empower themselves by participating in a whole host of school programmes throughout the school year.
