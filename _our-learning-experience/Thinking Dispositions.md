### Our Goals

Our school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) aims to develop students as thinkers who are skilful problem solvers. Students are encouraged to apply critical and inventive thinking skills to creatively resolve the diverse challenges they encounter within classrooms and their daily lives, as well as those in the community and the world and in their lives. 

### Our Approach

Our students’ thinking dispositions are developed through using Habits of Mind. This is a well-researched set of 16 Habits that guide students in solving problems, especially when the solutions are not immediately known or direct. In the face of increasing uncertainties and complexities in our world, students become successful problem-solvers when they can elicit contextual clues and skilfully employ these thinking dispositions.

**BUILDING FOUNDATIONS**  

Primary 1 and 2 students are introduced and explicitly taught the suite of 16 Habits. This helps students understand the Habits and how these can be applied in daily lives. An interactive hands-on approach is used alongside instructional videos.

**STRENGTHENING THE CORE**

For P3-6 students, Habits of Mind are integrated into different subjects to grow their application and use of thinking dispositions. Students are encouraged to apply the habits into a variety of settings such as in collaborative teamwork, approaching new knowledge and mastering new skills.
