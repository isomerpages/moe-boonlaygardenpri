<h2><strong>High Ability Learners (HAL)</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Our Goal</strong></h3>
<p>In BLGPS, we have a school-based identification process to identify our
High Ability Learners (HALs). Our HALs are curious, inquisitive, have high
reasoning skills and enjoy problem solving by nature.</p>
<p>Our goal is to nurture our HALs to grow in their ability (Gagne, 2003),
to remain engaged and challenged (Reis &amp; Renzulli, 2004; Maker, 2009),
to cultivate a love for learning (Gallagher &amp; Gallagher, 1994) and
develop their socio-emotional skills (Neihart, 2007).</p>
<h3><strong>Our Approach</strong></h3>
<p>To support our HALs, we have curated structured enrichment programmes
and Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL) lessons to challenge, enrich and empower
our HALs with the autonomy to construct their learning in a real-world
context. These learning experiences have developed our high ability learnersâ€™
critical and inventive thinking skills which are important 21st century
competencies which prepare them to be future ready.</p>
<p><u>Provision of Enrichment Programmes</u>
</p>
<p>Our HALs enrichment programmes such as the Reading &amp; Inquiry programme,
the Bicultural programme, Excellence 2000 (E2K) Science and E2K Mathematics
help to stretch our HALs' strength in Languages, Math and Science. In addition,
we also have the Innovation Programme (IvP) and Community Problem Solving
(CmPS) to strengthen our HALs in creative problem-solving and thinking
skills. These programmes deepen their interest in areas of passion, as
well as develop their domain strengths and capacity to make a positive
difference to their fields of study and community.</p>
