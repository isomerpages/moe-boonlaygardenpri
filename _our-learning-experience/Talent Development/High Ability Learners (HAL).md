<h2><strong>High Ability Learners (HAL)</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Our Goal</strong></h3>
<p>In BLGPS, we have a school-based identification process to identify our
High Ability Learners (HALs). Our HALs are curious, inquisitive, have high
reasoning skills and enjoy problem solving by nature.</p>
<p>Our goal is to nurture our HALs to grow in their ability (Gagne, 2003),
to remain engaged and challenged (Reis &amp; Renzulli, 2004; Maker, 2009),
to cultivate a love for learning (Gallagher &amp; Gallagher, 1994) and
develop their socio-emotional skills (Neihart, 2007).</p>
<h3><strong>Our Approach</strong></h3>
<p>To support our HALs, we have curated structured enrichment programmes
and Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL) lessons to challenge, enrich and empower
our HALs with the autonomy to construct their learning in a real-world
context. These learning experiences have developed our high ability learners’
critical and inventive thinking skills which are important 21st century
competencies which prepare them to be future ready.</p>
<p><u>Provision of Enrichment Programmes</u>
</p>
<p>Our HALs enrichment programmes such as the Reading &amp; Inquiry programme,
the Bicultural programme, Excellence 2000 (E2K) Science and E2K Mathematics
help to stretch our HALs' strength in Languages, Math and Science. In addition,
we also have the Innovation Programme (IvP) and Community Problem Solving
(CmPS) to strengthen our HALs in creative problem-solving and thinking
skills. These programmes deepen their interest in areas of passion, as
well as develop their domain strengths and capacity to make a positive
difference to their fields of study and community.</p>

<p><u>Provision of IBL Lessons during Curriculum Time</u>
</p>
<p>During lessons, our teachers adopt Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL) as our
key pedagogical approach to design and facilitate open-ended, interactive
and generative lessons for our HALs. These lessons motivate our HALs to
learn. They also have autonomy over their learning pace and the freedom
to make choices in their learning. Furthermore, their social interaction
and collaborative problem-solving is enriched through IBL. These lessons
also provide platforms for our HALs to engage in discussions on topics
of interest, fostering social interaction and collaborative problem-solving.</p>

<h3><strong>Professional Development for Teachers</strong></h3>
<p>We have a comprehensive professional development (PD) structure to equip
our teachers with the skills and knowledge to meet our HALs’ learning needs,
and to maximise their potential.</p>
<p>We also have a series of school-based professional development platforms
for our teachers to convene regularly to share innovative lesson ideas
and enriched activities to meet the learning needs of HALs. Our teacher
also receive mentorship support from our ST/ Learning Needs (HAL).</p>
