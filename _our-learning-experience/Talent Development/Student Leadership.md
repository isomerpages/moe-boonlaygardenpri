### Our Goals

We believe that every child should be given the opportunity to take on leadership roles to develop their leadership skills. With our motto of "Lead self to lead others", we hope that our students will be able to progress in their leadership journey and contribute back to the community with their leadership skills.  
  

### Our Approach

     style="width:100%">
	
#### Experience: Class-based leadership

Every student is given a chance to choose a leadership role to take on in class. Students are guided to look at their interest and strengths when choosing that role so that they can contribute at the class level.

#### Enrichment: Prefects and CCA leaders

Students who show the aptitude to take on greater leadership roles are chosen to take on leadership roles at the school level. Prefects will serve the student body in the daily functioning of the school while CCA leaders will serve during CCA days.

#### Excellence: Prefect EXCO

Students who have developed their leadership strengths serve at a greater level in the Prefect EXCO team. They lead the prefects and CCA leaders to contribute back to the school and community with their leadership skills.

### Key Programmes

#### STUDENT LEADERS' INVESTITURE

The Student Leaders' investiture celebrates the appointment of our student leaders in their new leadership role. In this investiture, our student leaders pledge to serve the student body with pride and be a good role model to them.  
  
Leading up to the investiture, three candidates from the P5 Prefect Exco are chosen to run for the Head Prefect election. They will have to use their leadership skills to be self-directed in preparing for their campaign which includes holding a speech rally to garner votes from the student body.

#### STUDENT LEADERS TRAINING

The school has regular training sessions once every term to help our students develop their leadership skills. These sessions focus on honing their skills in three domains - Self-leadership, Team-leadership and Thought-leadership. Time is set aside for our student leaders to share their success stories in their leadership journey with their peers.

#### VIA - PROJECT JOY

It is our belief that student leaders should use their leadership strength to contribute back to the community. One of the projects that our Prefect Exco team is in-charge of planning is Project JOY. They use their leadership skills to plan and execute the distribution of goodie bags, filled with necessities, to the needy families in the community. We believe that such opportunities will lead our student leaders to understand how they can see their leadership strength to impact others in the community positively.
