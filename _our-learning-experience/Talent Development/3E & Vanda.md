### Our Approach

Through a strengths-based approach, the school guides students to discover their unique natural talents, apply effort and energy to develop their skills, and grow their knowledge so that these natural abilities blossom into strengths.  

To do this, the school intentionally plans and implements programmes according to the strengths discovery and development frameworks of 3E and VANDA. 3E refers to the progressive stages of **E**xperience, **E**nrichment and **E**xcellence.  
*   Experience programmes focus on foundational skills and allow for discovery of personal strengths and areas of interests.  
    
*   Enrichment programmes enhance foundational skills and encourage development of strengths and area of interests.  
    
*   Excellence programmes are the pinnacle and they guide students to apply their strengths and skills to contribute to the school/community.  
   

VANDA refers to the reflective journey taken by students as they progress through their strength discovery and development stages under 3E. This includes guided reflections on Student Learning Space, teacher-student conversations and the VANDA recognition awards (Seed, Bloom and Blossom) to affirm students’ efforts in growing their strengths. The Blossom award in particular, recognizes students’ strengths development and their efforts in contributing to the school or the community. This is done through Student-initiated Projects where students are mentored by teachers in implementing an initiative to improve or benefit the school and the community.
