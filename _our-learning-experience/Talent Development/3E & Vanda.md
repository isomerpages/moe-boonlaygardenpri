### Our Goals

We believe that every child is different and has unique strengths. We strive to guide every student in exploring their interests and discovering their strengths, grow their dreams and achieve their aspirations.

### Our Approach

Through a strengths-based approach, the school guides students to discover their unique natural talents, apply effort and energy to develop their skills, and grow their knowledge so that these natural abilities blossom into strengths.  

To do this, the school intentionally plans and implements programmes according to the strengths discovery and development frameworks of 3E and VANDA. 3E refers to the progressive stages of **E**xperience, **E**nrichment and **E**xcellence.  
*   Experience programmes focus on foundational skills and allow for discovery of personal strengths and areas of interests.  
    
*   Enrichment programmes enhance foundational skills and encourage development of strengths and area of interests.  
    
*   Excellence programmes are the pinnacle and they guide students to apply their strengths and skills to contribute to the school/community.  
   

VANDA refers to the reflective journey taken by students as they progress through their strength discovery and development stages under 3E. This includes guided reflections on Student Learning Space, teacher-student conversations and the VANDA recognition awards (Seed, Bloom and Blossom) to affirm students’ efforts in growing their strengths. The Blossom award in particular, recognizes students’ strengths development and their efforts in contributing to the school or the community. This is done through Student-initiated Projects where students are mentored by teachers in implementing an initiative to improve or benefit the school and the community.

#### Key Programmes

**LEARNING BUFFET: A DISCOVERY OF STRENGTHS THROUGH CAREER-RELATED LEARNING**

Our annual Learning Buffet takes P4-6 students on learning journeys for a taste of on-the-job training. Students are presented with a wide range of industries and professions and have the autonomy to attend a workshop that best suits their interests and aspirational preference. Through career-related learning opportunities, students hear from industry experts on their roles and responsibilities and get to have hands-on practice at certain skillsets.

  

For example, our P5 students explored careers in the Investigative and Technological industry related to Green Jobs. In collaboration with NTU, they explored Environmental Engineering careers with NTU undergraduates in the Environmental Engineering faculty. They were given opportunities beyond the conventional classroom environment to work in the NTU laboratory on purifying water.

**FUTURE OF US**

The Future of Us carnival is a digital platform where students explore a rich depository of information related to professions that they are interested in. Encouraging self-directed learning, students are free to watch the video interviews with industry experts and complete mini challenges that were crafted by the professionals.
