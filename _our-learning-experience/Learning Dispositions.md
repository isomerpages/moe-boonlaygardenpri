<h2><strong>Learning Dispositions</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Our Goal</strong></h3>
<p>We recognise that every BLGian has the potential to be a <strong>Confident Learner</strong> who
finds joy in learning, holds the power to his/her future while pursuing
learning even when it gets challenging, and strives to support his/her
peers within the school community to achieve learning goals together.</p>
<h3><strong>Our Approach</strong></h3>
<p>To nurture our BLGians to be Confident Learners, our teachers develop
their<strong> learning dispositions</strong> to equip them with the 21<sup>st</sup> Century
Competencies, and the positive behaviours and attitudes that are important
for lifelong learning.</p>
<p>The four learning dispositions our students will acquire are <strong>Motivation</strong>, <strong>Self-directedness</strong>, <strong>Resilience</strong> and <strong>Connectedness</strong>.</p>

<h3><strong>Key programmes</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Learning Dispositions lessons and activities</strong></h3>
<p>Aligned to our schoolâ€™s vision of a garden where diversity blossoms, our
teachers design activities and create inclusive learning spaces that cater
to the readiness levels of our students. The Learning Dispositions lessons
and activities are enacted through our Back-to-School programme, FTGP lessons,
recess activities and learning environment. This ensures that every BLGian
has ample opportunities to practise and strengthen their learning dispositions.</p>
<p>Besides various hands-on activities and class discussions, BLGians also
demonstrate their learning through daily routines in school and at home,
to show how they have benefitted from the lessons taught and to pursue
lifelong learning beyond the classroom.</p>
