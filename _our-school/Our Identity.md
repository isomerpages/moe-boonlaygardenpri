### School Crest

<img src="/images/crest.gif" 
     style="width:30%">

The school colours are brown and white. These are the principal colours in the crest. The segments coloured half brown and half white symbolise a balance between the academic and the aesthetic programmes offered within the school curriculum.

The yellow gear motif highlights industry as a desirable employment quality for all races.

The book placed at the top of the logo design signifies the highest priority given to the education of our young in Singapore.
