<h4>‘Overview: BLGPS, a School Of The Future’</h4>
<p>The school’s learning environment is key to supporting students’ holistic
learning and learning experiences. As we prepare our students to be future-ready
in an ever-evolving world, our school’s learning spaces have been redesigned
to provide that rich context for learning and promote the development of
21st Century Competencies in our students.</p>
<p>To support our strategic priorities in transforming the learning experiences
for our students, our learning spaces have designed across three broad
themes: School as a Living Lab, School as a Second Home and School as a
Garden, with our students at the heart of it all.</p>
