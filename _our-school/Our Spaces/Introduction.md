<p>Our school has embarked on a journey of refreshing learning spaces to
enhance our efforts in developing 21CC in our students over the past few
years. This is also in line with MOE's direction as shared at the MOE Workplan
Seminar 2023. As we prepare our students to be future-ready in an ever-evolving
world, it is important that our physical environment is designed to support
learning experiences and quality education that develop students' 21CC
such as critical and inventive thinking, as well as collaboration and communication.</p>
<p>The learning spaces are designed across three broad themes: School as
a Living Lab, School as a Second Home and School as a Garden, with whole-school
alignment and our students' needs at the heart of it all.</p>
