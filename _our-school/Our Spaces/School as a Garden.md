<p>As Boon Lay Garden Primary School, a green campus and sustainable design
is a way of life. Beyond the effect of nature on wellbeing, designing our
school as a garden nurtures our students as the next generation of eco-stewards
who appreciate and contribute towards environmental sustainability.</p>

<p>The Lawn is our schoolâ€™s eco-hub, where students learn the importance
of sustainability through hands-on activities and learn to make a difference
for the environment through their daily actions.</p>
