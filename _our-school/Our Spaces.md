# OUR SPACES

**Secret Garden**

The Secret Garden has been a popular hangout for students in BLGPS. The facade of the library has been transformed to look like a garden in line with the school's vision. A treehouse was erected in the library as well to serve as a comfortable lounge area for students. Apart from having a wide repository of books, the library also has computers and iPads that our students borrow or book for research on school projects. The library is usually abuzz with activity after school and it is common to find students reading, completing homework or browsing the Internet.
