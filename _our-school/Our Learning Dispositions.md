<h2><strong>Learning Dispositions</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Our Goal</strong></h3>
<p>We recognise that every BLGian has the potential to be a <strong>Confident Learner</strong> who
finds joy in learning, holds the power to his/her future while pursuing
learning even when it gets challenging, and strives to support his/her
peers within the school community to achieve learning goals together.</p>
<h3><strong>Our Approach</strong></h3>
<p>To nurture our BLGians to be Confident Learners, our teachers develop
their<strong> learning dispositions</strong> to equip them with the 21<sup>st</sup> Century
Competencies, and the positive behaviours and attitudes that are important
for lifelong learning.</p>
<p>The four learning dispositions our students will acquire are <strong>Motivation</strong>, <strong>Self-directedness</strong>, <strong>Resilience</strong> and <strong>Connectedness</strong>.</p>
