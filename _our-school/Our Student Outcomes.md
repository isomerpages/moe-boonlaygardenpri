<p>A BLGian who embodies the BLGPS student outcomes should possess a good
sense of self-awareness of his/her strengths and interests, is grounded
in our schoolâ€™s CARE values, and has the dispositions, skills and knowledge
to take on the opportunities and challenges of the future. He/she should
be a <strong>Curious Thinker, Confident Learner</strong> and <strong>Compassionate Contributor</strong>.</p>
<h4><strong>Learning Goals of BLGPS Student Outcomes</strong></h4>
<p>Each student outcome consists of Learning Goals which describe what BLGians
should know and be able to do.</p>
