Boon Lay Garden Primary School has been partnering with Thye Hua Kwan (THK) Family Services Division since 2019 in offering evidence-based parenting programmes for our parents. One of these programmes, the Positive Parenting Programme (Triple P) will be rolled out in April. Please refer to the poster below by THK attached for more information.
