### Our Goals

The BLGPS Track & Field is a platform for students to learn about sprinting, long distance running and throwing. Track & Field members work closely as a team and learn to cooperate, respect each other and work harmoniously.

  

### Our Approach

The weekly trainings guide students to approach Track & Field events as a holistic learning experience that requires intentional focus, planning and perfecting of techniques, and reflecting on one's progress. To enhance students' learning, students take part in school competitions and the annual National Schools Games which provide students the chance to showcase their sporting talents and nurture their sportsmanship.
