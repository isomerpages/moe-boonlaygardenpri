### Our Goals  

BLGPS Netball is a platform for students to hone basic skills such as passing, shooting, footwork and movement. They will also be exposed to strategies of the game such as setting up an attack, winning the point and denying scoring opportunities. Through the sessions, we hope that the students will acquire important values such as teamwork, communication skills, sportsmanship and discipline.
  

### Our Approach

In weekly sessions, students are provided with various drills and game-based activities to apply the skills and concepts acquired. The team looks forward to sending both Junior and Senior teams for the annual National School Games in the coming years.
