### Our Goals

BLGPS Floorball is a platform for students to experience the fast-paced indoor sport which has been making waves in the local sports scene. Rapidly growing in popularity among students in school, floorball blends elements of ice hockey with components of team sports such as football and basketball.

  

### Our Approach

Through weekly trainings, students gain a deeper appreciation for the cardiovascular benefits of floorball as it is a high-intensity physical activity. Students gain endurance and stamina as they develop the agility and explosive power required in playing the sport. To enhance students' learning, students take part in school competitions. They also take part in the annual National Schools Games which provide students the chance to showcase their sporting talents and nurture their sportsmanship.
