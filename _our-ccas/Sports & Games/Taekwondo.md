### Our Goals

BLGPS Taekwondo provides a platform for students to learn the Korean martial art that teaches more than just self-defence. Students gain a deeper appreciation of the techniques (stances, blocks, kicks and punches) and moves as they develop values that are integral to Taekwondo: self-control, integrity, perseverance and an indomitable spirit.

  

### Our Approach

To enhance students' learning, grading sessions are conducted every 3 months. This enables students to monitor their progress and achieve a promotion in belt level. Taekwondo members take part in the annual National School Games - Taekwondo Championships which provide them the opportunity to showcase their sporting talents and nurture their sportsmanship.
