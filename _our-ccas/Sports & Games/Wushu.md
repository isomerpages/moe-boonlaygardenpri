### Our Goals

The BLGPS Wushu is a platform for students to learn the Chinese martial arts form which incorporates a wide array of routines such as the 3-duan Nanquan. Learning Wushu also instils values such as discipline, respect, patience and perseverance.

  

### Our Approach

Through weekly training sessions, students develop aerobic and anaerobic endurance, flexibility, balance and coordination. To enhance students' learning, they take part in school competitions and the annual National Schools Game, which annual National Schools Games, which provide students with a chance to showcase their sporting talents and nurture their sportsmanship.
