### Our Goals  

BLGPS Bowling is a platform for students to experience bowling as a fun and exciting sport. As students learn to coordinate their movements, they practise resilience and take ownership in monitoring their progress and improvement in techniques.

  

### Our Approach

In weekly training, students are guided in techniques such as holding the ball, approaching the lane and releasing the ball. The BLGPS Bowling Team is made up of Senior (Boys/Girls) and Junior (Boys/Girls) members and they take part in the annual National Schools Games - Bowling Championships which allow students to showcase their sporting talents and nurture their sportsmanship.
