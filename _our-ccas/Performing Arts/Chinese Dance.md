### Our Goals

The BLGPS Chinese Dance aims to develop students' passion for cultural dance through training in Chinese Dance styles and basic movements that embody stories and traditions. The learning experiences guide them in developing responsibility, teamwork and confidence.

  

### Our Approach

In weekly practices, students are taught specific stretching exercises and dance techniques which nurture a deeper appreciation for Chinese Dance. In addition, students participate in school and external performances, and attend dance performances. The students also take part in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) which allows them to showcase their diverse artistic talents.
