<h3>Our Goals</h3>
<p>The BLGPS Choir aims to develop students' passion for singing through
musicianship lessons and choral training under the tutelage of a choir
conductor. The learning experiences guide them in developing self-discipline,
confidence and poise.</p>
<h3>Our Approach</h3>
<p>Through weekly practices, students learn a wide repertoire of songs in
different languages. Their learning is further enhanced through platforms
such as school and external performances, attending musical concerts and
participating in music workshops and local choir exchanges. The BLGPS Choir
also takes part in Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) which provides student
the opportunity to showcase their diverse artistic talents.</p>
