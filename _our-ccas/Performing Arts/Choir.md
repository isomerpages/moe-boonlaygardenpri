### Our Goals

The BLGPS Choir aims to develop students' passion for singing through musicianship lessons and choral training under the tutelage of a choir conductor. The learning experiences guide them in developing self-discipline, confidence and poise.

### Our Approach

Through weekly practices, students learn a wide repertoire of songs in different languages. Their learning is further enhanced through platforms such as school and external performances, attending musical concerts and participating in music workshops and local choir exchanges. The BLGPS Choir also takes part in Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) which provides student the opportunity to showcase their diverse artistic talents.
