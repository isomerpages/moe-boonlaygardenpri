### Our Goals

The BLGPS Indian Dance aims to develop students' passion for cultural dance through training in classical and modern Indian Dance. As students dance harmoniously to lively music, they develop teamwork and acquire coordination.

### Our Approach

To enhance students' learning, they take part in school and external performances. They also take part in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) which provides students the opportunity to showcase their diverse artistic talents.
