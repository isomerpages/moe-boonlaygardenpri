### Our Goals

The BLGPS Malay Dance aims to develop students' passion for cultural dance through training in basic and advanced dance skills.  
  
### Our Approach

In weekly sessions, students are guided to appreciate the beauty of dance and to enjoy the music and rhythm of dance movements. To enhance students' learning, they take part in school and external performances. The BLPS Malay Dance also takes part in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) which provides students the chance to showcase their diverse artistic talents.
