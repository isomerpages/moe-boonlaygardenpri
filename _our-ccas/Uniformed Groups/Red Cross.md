### Our Goals

BLGPS Red Cross aims to develop compassion and a will to act in students by integrating character-building, leadership and basic First Aid skills in its programmes.

  

### Our Approach

In weekly sessions, students also participate in community service and have opportunities to organise combined activities with other Uniformed Groups and Cadet-Link event partners. In totality, the activities organised nurture citizenship dispositions, a strong sense of civic responsibility and values such as resilience and teamwork.
