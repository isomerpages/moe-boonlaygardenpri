### Our Goals

BLGPS Cub Scouts aims to develop students who are able to face and overcome challenges.

  

### Our Approach

In weekly sessions, students are taught basic scouting skills and they mark achievements in areas such as campcraft, air and water activities, citizenship and improving the environment. The fun and educational learning experiences provide a safe and positive environment for students to develop physical fitness, acquire lifeskills and gain a greater appreciation for community service.
