### Our Goals  

BLGPS Environmental Club aims to develop eco-stewards who advocate sustainability by role-modelling environmentally friendly practices.  
  

### Our Approach

In weekly sessions, students learn to care for the environment through the 3R approach and upcycling. To enhance students’ learning, there are opportunities to participate in community-based events which develop residents’ environmental awareness.
