### Goals

BLGPS AV & Media Club aims to cultivate students’ interest in the use of Audio-Visual and Information Technology such as photography, videography and animation. These varied learning experiences inculcate the importance of coordination and teamwork, trouble-shooting and adaptability.  
  

### Approach

In weekly sessions, students attend workshops and are also taught the use and maintenance of AV equipment. Opportunities for students to apply their learning include providing AV support for daily flag-raising ceremonies and school events.
