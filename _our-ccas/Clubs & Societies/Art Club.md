### Our Goals

BLGPS Art Club aims to develop students’ artistic talents through a wide variety of learning experiences on different art forms and media. Through weekly sessions, students will gain a deeper appreciation for art as an expression of self.  

  

### Our Approach

Students’ art pieces are regularly displayed in exhibitions held within school and at external organisations. To enhance students’ learning, there are opportunities to participate in internal and external competitions, as well as participate in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) for Visual Arts Presentation that is held once every two years.
